Welcome to the official `MLGodotKit <https://github.com/Hunter174/MLGodotKit>`_ documentation!

MLGodotKit is a native machine learning and reinforcement learning toolkit for
the Godot Engine built ontop of C++. My goal is to enable dynamic, data-driven behaviors directly
inside games and simulations, with an emphasis on real-time execution,
transparency, and engine-level integration.

The project spans a range of techniques, from classical linear algebra and
optimization to neural networks and reinforcement learning, and is designed to
serve as a practical foundation for AI-driven gameplay and interactive learning
systems.

To get an overview of the project architecture and design philosophy, start with
the :ref:`introduction_page`.

Getting Started
